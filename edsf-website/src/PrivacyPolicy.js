          If users give consent to our use of Google Analytics cookies, we
          collect and store geolocational data - the country from where the
          website query was done - in order to adapt our educational programme
          to the potential participants' background. For example, if we observe
          a high request for specific training material from a certain country,
          we can design specific courses that relate close to this country's
          involvement on big data technologie education.

          Further, we collect and store the amount of clicks for internal and
          external links. This gives us an impression on which sites are
          considered interesting or useful by our target audience, and allows us
          to put more focus on the highly-demanded content.

          For internal links, we track the page routing of a user with Google
          Analytics - meaning that we gain insight on how users travel between
          internal pages. Here, also the amount of time spent on a specific page
          is saved.

          Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the gathering,
          collection and analysis of data about the behavior of visitors to

          referrers, which subpages of the website were accessed or how often
          and for which period of time a subpage was viewed. A web analysis is

          address transferred through your browser to Google Analytics will not
          be combined with other data held by Google. In addition, this website
          uses the Analytics feature UserID to track interaction data. This User
          ID will be additionally anonymized and encrypted and will not be
          linked with other data. You can prevent the storage of cookies by a
