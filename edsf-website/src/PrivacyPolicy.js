            We have integrated Google Analytics into our website with an
            IP-anonymization function, which allow us to evaluate user behavior
            and user interests for educational purposes. If the use of Google
            Analytics cookies has been accepted by the user, we retrieve
            geolocational data of users - the country from where the website has
            been requested. This can help us to adapt our educational offer to
            local interests, e.g. by providing courses with a specific focus on
            a certain country and its infrastructure if there is a high
            interest. Further, we retrieve the route travel of subpages within
            our website - for how long and from which subpage to which subpage
            users move. This can help us to analyze which topics or courses are
            of most interest for users, being potential course attendees.
            Finally, we retrieve data about clicked links that redirect to
            external websites - for example, as it is the case for educational
            material offered and uploaded via external providers. This can help
            us to know which course material is most often used and looked up,
            what can eventually motivate us to broadcast the course material on
            more open platforms, such as Youtube.

            Google Analytics is a web analytics service. Web analysis is the
            gathering, collection and analysis of data about the behavior of
            visitors to websites. Among other things, a web analysis service
            collects data on which website a data subject has come to a website
            from so-called referrers, which or how often subpages of the website
            were accessed and for which time period a subpage was viewed. A web
            analysis is mainly used to optimize a website and for the
            cost-benefit analysis of Internet advertising. However, we do not
            use it for any advertising or commercial purposes, but solely for
            educational purposes. The operator of the Google Analytics component

            States of the European Union or other states in agreement with the

            address is sent to and shortened by a Google server in the USA. On
            behalf of the website operator, Google can use this information to
            evaluate your website use, compile reports on your activity and
            provide further services related to the website use to us. The IP
